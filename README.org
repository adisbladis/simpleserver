* Simpleserver - A go replacement for SimpleHTTPServer

Instead of
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python -m http.server
#+END_SRC

Just use
#+BEGIN_SRC
simpleserver
#+END_SRC

Thats it! You now have a directory listing webserver running.

Optionally you can allow upload (and get a form on the directory listings)
#+BEGIN_SRC
simpleserver --allow-uploads
#+END_SRC

And if you want to listen on another port
#+BEGIN_SRC
simpleserver --port 9001
#+END_SRC


Note that this requires the CAP_SYS_CHROOT capability as it chroots into the listed directory
